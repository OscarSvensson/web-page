                        This page is about the pursuit of living off the land and using the resources found in nature to 
                        provide for oneself. Humans have had a close relationship with the land for thousands of years, 
                        only to lose that connection over the span of a few generations. My wish is to find my way back. 
                        At least in some form or capacity.

                    <h3>Safety</h3>
                    <p>
                        The stuff I describe is how I do things. That does not always mean that it will work for you or your 
                        situation. I am not an expert, and you might not be either. Use your own judgement, and do the research 
                        before attempting any project. Activities such as identifying plants and mushrooms for eating, felling 
                        trees, working with sharp tools or lighting fires are all safe when done right. But can be hazardous or 
                        even lethal in some cases if you are uncareful.

                    <h3>Rights of usage</h3>
                    <p>
                        I will describe what you can do with the stuff you find in nature, and not whether you are allowed to 
                        do so. That will depend on where in the world you are, who owns the land, and other stuff. I am fortunate 
                        enough to own land, but there is some stuff that is available for anyone to forage in most countries.

                    <div class="article-header"><h3>Laundry detergent from Horse chestnut</h3></div>
                    <p>
                        Conkers from Aesculus hippocastanum, horse chestnut, can be used as a laundry detergent. The conkers contain 
                        some stuf that make them ineddible, but are also rich in saponins. Saponins are a natural soapy substance that help disolve grease.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Harvesting</h4>
                    <p>
                        When conkers drop to the ground in autumn. They are easy to both find and identify, once you
                         have found a tree. Each tree also drop huge amounts of conkers, wich makes it easy to harvest 
                         large amounts.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Processing and storage</h4>
                    <p>You can use or process them in a number of ways, but the way that I personally find easiest is to 
                        quarter and dry them. Simply chop each one into four pieces and spread them out and leave them in a
                         warm dry place for a few days.<br>
                         Once dry they store in a glass jar for years, provided that you keep them away from moisture.<br>
                         I have read of methods where you grind or chop the conkers to a powder, which should help the saponins 
                         leech out easier. I do however find that the quarter size pieces do the job just fine, and if I can save 
                         some time and effort and just use the larger pieces, that is the way to go for me.<br>
                         Some sources will tell you to remove the brown shell when washing white laundry, as this part is said to cause 
                         miscolorings on the laundry. I have not seen this happen myself, but you might be careful with this, and avoid 
                         washing any heirloom textiles this way.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Take 6-8 dried or fresh quarters and tie them in a sock. throw in the sock together with the rest of the 
                        laundry, and run the same program you would otherwise have used.
